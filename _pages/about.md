I'm a 5th-year Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interests include **Transfer Learning**, **Face Perception and Understanding**, **LMMs**, and **Data-Centric AI**.\
I graduated from the School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering at [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/) with a bachelorâ€™s degree in 2020.
